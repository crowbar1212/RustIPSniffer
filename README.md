
This program uses rust code to create an IP address sniffer

In order to replicate this program, do the following: 
    -Install Visual Studio Code
    -Install Rust and Github extensions
    -Sign-in and connect to an existing Github account and repository
    -Use command line to install/verify that rust is installed
    -Follow Youtube video guide, source code on gitHub is linked below in order to verify accuracy as well as to verify what certain symbols are/how they are typed in VSCode




Currently I was unable to get this code working, as there appears to be a false error flag that I'm unsure how to resolve on line 12. It says field is never read however that line is used in the next function impl Arguments. Linked image shows what happens when this code is run: https://imgur.com/a/Rm7lyvI
